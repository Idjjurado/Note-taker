In this application you can create and manage notes that you need to jot down!
Whether it be something as simple as a phone number or maybe something as complex as a to-do list!

Begin by selecting the button to take you to the notes page! Here you can edit the title and contents
of the nest that you are currently writing. Once finished you can click the save icon and see your note
populate within the list!
